## 🔧 What I Work On

### 🛰️ Autonomous Control
Feedback control, MPC, and robust control for nonlinear aerospace and robotic systems.

### 📐 Trajectory Optimization
Optimal control using CasADi and IPOPT, with uncertainty-aware constraints and belief-space reasoning.

### 🧠 State Estimation
Kalman filters, particle filters, and probabilistic inference for safety-critical autonomy.

### 🤖 Robotics & Simulation
ROS2-based multi-robot systems, physics-based simulation, SLAM, and perception.
