I’m a graduate aerospace engineer at the University of Michigan focused on autonomous systems, control, and robotics. My work combines trajectory optimization, state estimation, and feedback control to build robust, end-to-end autonomy pipelines — from spacecraft docking to multi-robot simulation. With prior industry experience shipping production Python systems, I care deeply about algorithms that are not just elegant, but deployable.

## 🧩 Professional Engineering Experience

Before transitioning fully into aerospace autonomy research, I worked for **three years as a Python developer in industry**, where I designed and deployed **production-scale automation and machine learning systems**.

- Built and maintained **CI/CD pipelines** for Python services, ensuring reproducibility, automated testing, and safe deployments
- Developed **RESTful APIs (FastAPI)** and event-driven automation workflows used in live production environments
- Collaborated across engineering and data science teams using **Git-based workflows, code reviews, and agile development**
- Optimized reliability and latency of automation pipelines operating under real operational constraints

This background allows me to approach robotics and autonomy problems with a **software-first, deployment-aware mindset**, bridging research-grade algorithms with real-world systems.

### 🛠️ Software Engineering & MLOps
- Production Python, object-oriented design, performance profiling
- CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, version-controlled deployments
- FastAPI, RESTful services, system integration
- Linux, Git, Agile workflows
